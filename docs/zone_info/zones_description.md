# Zone

- we name 'zone' the polygonal shape linked to a particular narrative asset set.

- we have two sets of zones. The production zones which defines areas around the ile saint louis in Paris, and a 'dev' set which defines areas around the rue des mara√Æchers in Geneva.

- we encode the sets as closed polygons in the geojson format. 

- we identify the zones with the property 'zone\_id'.

## zoning data info
