## Installation
From github,    

    git clone https://github.com/evaletolab/geospatial-resources
    cd geospatial-resources
    make install
    make test

Easiest way to install geospatial-resources is by using npm *(not yet ready for production)*:

    npm install --save geospatial-resources


## Running unit tests

To run unit tests you need [Mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/mocha),
and [should.js](https://github.com/visionmedia/should.js). The tests are run simply by simply typing:

    NODE_ENV=test ./node_modules/.bin/mocha

Do not run tests with your live processor. Make sure you are running in a
sandbox.
